    **"Let's Get Started with React"**

    There are two authenticate ways to learn react that we have come across!.
            - Refer React Documentation and developer guide and get it going. {since website of such are very cryptic and brief so we won't get in-depth knowledge of React but it is a way to follow.
        
            - {Recommended way}:- Udemy Tutorial of web developer Stephan Girder on Modern ReactJS
            {There are Total 34 Seasons in this tutorial among  which only 1-26 should be followed.}
            https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux/


2. WH Types of ReactJS!.
    -Let us set up Node Environment & Dive in React:
        Get familiar with all the basic concepts of ReactJS such as
        1. JSX
        2. Functional Components
        3. Class-based Components
        4. Props System
        5. State System.
        P.S. this is basic knowledge for React, which is necessary to build web apps in ReactJS

    -Assignment:
        Build a React app that greets the user and shows the current time, date & day on screen.
        Greeting Scenarios:
            1. Good Morning: if the current time is between 6:00 AM to 12:00 PM
            2. Good Afternoon: if the current time is between 12:00 PM to 4:00 PM
            3. Good Evening: if the current time is between 4:00 PM to 8:00 PM
            4. Good Night: if the current time is after 8:00 PM.
        {Hint & Clues: Use Date JS Object}

3. Way Deep In ReactJS.
    Look for React Bootstrap for Readymade UI components & Also Container, Row, & Column Layout to make UI responsive. & create an application using React Bootstrap that displays two images side by side on Laptop and when opened the name App on mobile those images displayed one after other in the column.
	{Mobile View & Desktop View}

4. Redux!. Redux System in ReactJS

Redux System can be our saviour when it comes to managing data along with different components and using Redux inside our applications can reduce our data management complexities when the code base of application is vast and huge.


5. A Mini Project in ReactJS.
Things, which are must & Compulsory, should be included:
    1. Redux System
    2. Routing Since the application has to be multi-pages
    3. Own JSON Server to save & manage data of the application.
    4. API Requests to fetch & store data on JSON Server via Redux!.
